To run the urdf model in RViZ and see it's working,
steps:

Download urdf_tutorial folder to any directory of your choice
Open the folder in terminal
Must look like ...blah-blah/urdf_tutorial/ $
run -
$ roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=urdf/claw.urdf
The joint state publisher values can be adjusted 

Feel free to add a base of the robot along with 4 wheels,
We may be ale to make the entire robot from scratch without having to use solid works.
