modified environment(found over internet) for testing of bot(placed balls on the roads), revisiting ros-gazebo tutorials to clear doubts.

* Made an environment for testing, by adding a few road elements. Made a SW model of the sign board and exported it into the environment.
 // Facing error exporting the colors of the SW model
* Went through the ROS-GAZEBO tutorials. Made a clarity on the controllers,transmissions and plugins.

Read the documentation on ROS site for the SW Add-in and its usage.
Installed visual studio and the required repo and then installed the SW add-in
Saw some YT videos for using the SW add-in for exporting and then exported the assembly as a urdf.
Tried opening urdf on ubuntu in rviz and gazebo by making a package but nothing was visible, 
I tried to figure out stuff from the bugs but nothing was clear.

Studied some ROS and Gazebo concepts and watched a YT playlist for the same.
Made new package with the modified assembly of the bot and new claw.
running the above package did not made the bot visible at first but 
after some frame fixes it was visible in rviz but some of the parts were dangling
and the model in the gazebo environment was moving all but itself very randomly
I discussed this with team mates and mentors and came at some conlusion 
regarding collison of parts and clearences.
Made a new package with the modified version of the bot and tried to run it,
got much better results but a lot has to be fixed yet.
