Searched the web for solution regarding opening a F360 file in Solidworks.
Started with studying about important robot parts like wheels, extensions and claws. 
Did dimensioning for the bot and completed the model except the claw in Fusion 360.
Tried opening the model in Solidworks and fixing joints... but that didn't work.
did more research on exporting different types of files from F360 but nothing worked well as per the demands.

After all attempts to convert a F360 model to a SW model gone unsuccesful, 
I started making a new model from scratch in SW and completed it the same day including the claw. 
As I am not used to SW it took me more time than expected and
I had to study some about some sections of the SW like joints and Joint limits.

I started with studying about conversion of SW models to urdf on ROS site, and the SW Add-In for it.
Installed Visual Studio and downloaded the Repo required, 
read its documentation and ran the SW Add-In Installation that took a lot time to finish.
Saw some YT videos for using the SW add-in for exporting and then exported the assembly as a urdf.
Tried opening urdf on ubuntu in rviz and gazebo by making a package but nothing was visible, 
I tried to figure out stuff from the bugs but nothing was clear.

I figured out that some issues regarding joints and origins were there in the SW to URDF export so,
I made a new assembly using the parts, keeping symmetry around the origin so that I can crosscheck the URDF manually
Exported the Urdf...
Made small changes in the design, mostly altering the dimensions to provide an mm of clearences at the joint
because I figured out (with the help of mentors and team members) that maybe my model was unstable in gazebo due
to collisons of parts with each other and overlap. 
Export new (Third) urdf and ran it... I got improved results but still a lot is there to br fixed.

Made some small changes in the dimensions of the model and
Made seperate assemblies for bot base and claw so that the team can work on their controls seperately
and exported their corresponding urdfs.
